I recently completed my Master’s in Business Analytics, building on earlier studies in HR, Economics, and Business. I’m naturally curious, and enjoy understanding how data, people, and processes connect – and what actually drives the patterns we see.
Most of my work revolves around data analysis, predictive modeling, business insights, and process understanding. 

This GitHub collects projects where I explore customer behavior, processes, forecasting, and analytical workflows, combining both academic work and things I created simply because I wanted to understand something better. Instead of learning by "copying" tutorials, I try to build my own projects that solve real questions or real problems.
