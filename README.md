I recently completed my **Master’s in Business Analytics**, following several years of studies in **HR**, **Economics**, and **Business**.  
I’m passionate about learning new analytical methods and exploring how data can be used to improve processes and support smarter business decisions.  

Here you’ll find projects that explore topics such as business analysis, customer behavior, and predictive modeling - including both coursework and self-initiated projects.  

💡 What excites me most is uncovering **patterns, trends, and drivers** behind real-world data, and communicating them in a clear and structured way.  
📝 I value **clear documentation, communication, and storytelling** in my projects, making complex insights understandable for both technical and non-technical audiences.
