Fresh graduate leaving behind my ‚Äúforever student‚Äù label after 7 years of studies ‚Äì resulting in two bachelor‚Äôs degrees and a master‚Äôs degree. My academic background spans **HR & Personnel Management**, **Economics & Business Administration**, and most recently **Business Analytics**.  

**_Even though I have a wide span of business-related competencies, this profile mainly highlights my technical skills._**  

üí° What excites me most is turning **data into actionable insights** ‚Äì whether that means exploring business strategies, analyzing customer behavior, or building machine learning models.  
üìù I emphasize **clear documentation, communication, and storytelling** in my projects, making complex insights understandable for both technical and non-technical audiences.
